# Critical Zoomer
a mandelbrot set zoomer written in rust

## How to use (linux)
- download & run the latest binary

## Controls
- movement: mouse drag
- adjust zoom: scroll

## Scope
- the mandelbrot set, and tracking a given point and overlaying its path. (and maybe displaying a given point's julia set)

## Opinions
- The mandelbrot set is the only nontrivial fractal that isn't ugly.

## Da plan (subject to change)

### The MVP 0 (0.0.1)  done!
- blazing fast window exists | ✔️
- workday-based worker exists | ✔️
- window and worker communicate | ✔️
- ️no iteration count; all results are always calculated completely until escape or loop. | ✔️
  
### Fix the jank (0.0.2) done!
- window / worker linkakge is stable during quick inputs | ✔️
- fix drag after zoom | ✔️
- fix drag too far | ✔️
- window / worker handle resolution changes | ✔️
- fix zoom while drag | ✔️
- implement home button functionality | ✔️

### workgroup rewrite (0.0.3) done!

- worker no longer workday based, but workshift and checks its in channel every shift | ✔️
- rework worker resolution and updates; add work collector after worker so worker can send updates at a fixed rate | ✔️
- fix work cancellation | ✔️
- fix work skipping | ✔️
- rewrite WC / window linkage | ✔️
- fix zoom while drag | ✔️
- fix home button | ✔️
- fix screen resizing | ✔️

### work saving (0.0.4) done! (for now)

- add work collector actor | ✔️
- implement work saving when zooming in | ✔️
- implement CD | ✔️

### work saving 2 + flood fill (0.0.5) done!

- work saving when moving | ✔️
- flood fill out points | ✔️

### settings (0.0.6) done

- fix zoom too far | ✔️
- settings page allows custom layering of colorings | ✔️
- also allows animation of variables | ✔️

## KMF (v0.0.7) done

- misc

## minor bugfix (v0.0.8) done

- fix work noncomplete | done
- fix unclean shutdown | done
